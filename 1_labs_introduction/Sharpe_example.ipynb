        "In 1966, William Sharpe introduced the so-called <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/sr/sr.htm\"><em>reward-to-variability ratio</em></a>. While, by Prof. Sharpe's own admission, the \"measure has gained considerable popularity, the name has not.\" For years to come, researchers have termed the original version of the measure the Sharpe Index, the Sharpe Measure, or the Sharpe Ratio (Morningstar). We will use the latter term in this tutorial. \n",
        "\n",
        "The Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure of investment return that uses standard deviation to represent risk, and it is one of the most popular risk-adjusted performance measures in finance. In its original form, the Sharpe Ratio is calculated as the expected excess return on an asset over the risk-free rate divided by the standard deviation of the excess return:\n",

        "\n",
        "where $R_{rf}$ is the benchmark/ risk-free return, $R_p$ is the portfolio return, $ùëÅ$ is the number of sampling periods in a year. It is common to use the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS\"> three-month T-bill rate</a> as the risk-free interest rate. The portfolio return and risk-free rate can be observed at any frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, etc), as long as they are consistent for both measures. For instance, Morningstar calculates a monthly $Sharpe Ratio$ and then annualises it to put the number in a more useful one-year context, as follows:\n",

        "&nbsp;\n",
        "\n",
        "We will follow Morningstar's approach in this tutorial. Also, while the Sharpe ratio is typically calculated for a portfolio of assets, in this tutorial we will use stocks instead of portfolios.\n",
        "\n",
        "The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better the asset‚Äôs historical risk-adjusted performance. It is often used to compare and rank portfolio managers with similar strategies on the basis of excess return each portfolio achieved per unit of total risk."
